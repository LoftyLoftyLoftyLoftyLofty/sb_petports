--  M.A.U.S. UTILITY UNIT -- PLACEMENT VALIDATION
--
--  "Is this a polite place to stop?"
--
--  Every resting action needs this: sleeping, idling, and picking somewhere to
--  stand while waiting. A pet that settles in front of the captain's chair, a
--  storage crate, or a light switch is the single most complained-about thing
--  about vanilla ship pets, and it is not drift -- sleepAction actively
--  TELEPORTS the pet onto its sleep target with mcontroller.setPosition. Any
--  validation that only gates approach will miss the acute case.
--
--  WHY OCCUPANCY AND NOT INTERACTIVITY
--
--  The obvious approach is "do not stand in front of interactable objects", and
--  it does not work. Interactivity is a RUNTIME property: /objects/wired/light/
--  light.lua calls object.setInteractive(config.getParameter("interactive",
--  true)), so a light switch is interactive by default with nothing in its
--  config saying so. Any predicate built out of config parameters
--  (interactAction, slotCount, sitPosition...) will have holes, and the holes
--  will look arbitrary to a player.
--
--  So this checks OCCUPANCY instead: does the pet's footprint overlap the tiles
--  an object occupies? No guessing about intent, no per-type special cases, and
--  it covers objects from mods that do not exist yet.
--
--  Slightly over-broad -- a pet will also decline to nap in front of a purely
--  decorative wall panel. That is a much better failure mode than napping in
--  front of the one thing the player needed.
--
--  PLACEMENT-TIME, NOT A LEASE
--
--  A spot is validated when a unit settles into it and never re-checked. Close
--  a door on a sleeping unit and it stays put. That is deliberate: a pet that
--  bolted whenever the world changed around it would be worse than one that
--  occasionally needs stepping over.
--
--  ALLOW-LIST, NOT DENY-LIST
--
--  Objects are off-limits unless they say otherwise, via the perch tag below.
--  A deny-list would mean enumerating every object a pet should avoid, which is
--  unbounded and grows with every mod installed. This way an unknown object is
--  treated as furniture to stay off, which fails safe. Tag the pet house and any
--  deliberate perch and nothing else needs to care.

--  An object carrying this in its itemTags may be rested on.
local PERCH_TAG = "petports_perch"

--  Optional per-object offset from the perch's entity position to the spot a
--  unit should actually come to rest on. An object's entity position is its
--  anchor tile, which is rarely where the art implies a unit should curl up --
--  same problem the vent solves with entryOffset, same shape of solution.
